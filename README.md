### Rick and Morty Database

#### Abstract
This is a solo project completed during Mod 3 at Turing School of Software and Design.  The purpose of this project is to create database that holds information of characters from the show "Rick and Morty". The primary audience for this application is for teenagers and young adults that are fans of the show.  The application allows the users to see all of the characters that are in the show, view details of the character, and add characters to a favorites list.
